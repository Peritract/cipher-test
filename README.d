# Word Game (Scrabble)

## Background

The [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is an encryption technique which encodes information by shifting each letter a certain number of places in the alphabet.

For example, using a shift of `2`, the string "hello" is encoded as "jgnnq". "elephant" is "ovozrkxd" using a shift of 10.

In this challenge, you'll write code to encrypt and decrypt information using the Caesar Cipher.

## ⚠️ Note

There is **far** too much work here to be done in the time you've been given. You are **not** expected to complete the whole challenge. 

## Tasks

1. Decrypt an encrypted string using a shift of 13.
2. Decrypt an encrypted string using a given shift.
3. Encode a plaintext string using a shift of 10. Only letters (A-Z, a-z) should be transformed.
4. Encode a plaintext string using a provided shift of 10. Only letters (A-Z, a-z) should be transformed.
5. Given an encrypted string with an unknown shift, identify all possible decryptions.
6. Given an encrypted string with an unknown shift, identify the three most likely decryptions.
